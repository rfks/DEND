# Data Engineering Nano Degree by Udacity
## Project 1 - Data modeling with postgres
### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
### Project Description
To complete the project, we need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
   * _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

#### Dimension Tables
1. **users** - users in the app
   * _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
2. **songs** - songs in music database
   * _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
3. **artists** - artists in music database
   * _artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude_
4. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
   * _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_

## Project Template
In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:

1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let us check our database.
2. `create_tables.py` drops and creates our tables. we need to run this file to reset our tables before each time we run our ETL scripts.
3. `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from **song_data** and **log_data** and loads the data into our tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes files from **song_data** and **log_data** and loads them into our tables.
5. `sql_queries.py` contains all our sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. `README.md` provides discussion on this project.

## How to run the project

```sh
root@xyz:home/workspace# python create_tables.py
root@xyz:home/workspace# python etl.py
```

We can check the sample results using the `test.ipynb` notebook.
